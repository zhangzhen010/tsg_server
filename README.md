## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

- Java 17+

## üèóÔ∏è Setting

1. Before starting the project, you need to install the MongoDB and Redis databases locally.

2. Create a database named webgame_game_data in the MongoDB database, and then import the configuration from the mongo directory in the project into the webgame_game_data database.

3. Modify the application.yml file in the resource directory of the GameWebGameServer module, and change the database connection configuration to the local MongoDB connection address:

```sh
  #mongodb
  data:
    mongodb:
      #db
      uri: mongodb://orange:Orange_qnmw2018_3@192.168.110.111:27017/webgame_game?authSource=admin
      #data
      data:
        uri: mongodb://orange:Orange_qnmw2018_3@192.168.110.111:27017/webgame_game_data?authSource=admin
      logs:
        uri: mongodb://orange:Orange_qnmw2018_3@192.168.110.111:27017/webgame_game_log?authSource=admin
```

4. Modify the redis.xml file in the resource directory of the GameWebGameServer module, and change the ip, port, and auth settings to the local Redis connection information:

```sh
<ip>192.168.110.111</ip>
<port>6379</port>
<auth>Orange_qnmw2018_3</auth>
```
